    "### Non-linear Hypothesis\n",
    "With many variables in your problem, your number of features grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning problems have a lot of variables. Example: computer vision, identifying a car. 2500 pixels * 3 for rgb. With all quadratic permutations, there would be 3 million features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are good for identifying complex classifications (when n is very large)\n",

    "### Neurons and the brain\n",
    "Brain seems to work on one single \"learning algorithm\". Or at least very similar variations of the one.\n",
