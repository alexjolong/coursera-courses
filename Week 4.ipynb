    "# Week 4\n",
    "## Motivations\n",
    "### Non-linear Hypothesis\n",
    "With many variables in your problem, your number of features grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning problems have a lot of variables. Example: computer vision, identifying a car. 2500 pixels * 3 for rgb. With all quadratic permutations, there would be 3 million features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are good for identifying complex classifications (when n is very large)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neurons and the brain\n",
    "Brain seems to work on one single \"learning algorithm\". Or at least very similar variations of the one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural Networks (I'm effing pumped)\n",
    "### Model Representation I\n",
    "Neurons take in multiple inputs, perform some processing, and send one output to a different neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "weights = parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "first layer is \"input layer\", last output is \"output layet\"\n",
    "In-between layers are \"hidden layers\", because you don't get to observe training sets..\n",
    "\n",
    "If network has sj units in layer j and sj+1 units in layer j+1, then theta^j will be of dimension sj+1 X (sj + 1).\n",
    " * The \"+ 1\" comes from bias node x0 and theta^j0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Representation II\n",
    "Forward propogation:\n",
    "z^2 = theta^1 x\n",
    "a^2 = g(z^2)\n",
    "z^2 = g(theta^1 x)\n",
    "\n",
    "a^2\\[0\\] = 1\n",
    "z^3 = theta^2 a^2\n",
    "h(x) = a^3 = g(z^3)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "### Examples and Intuitions I\n",
    "This was pretty straightforward I didn't take notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples and Intuitions II\n",
    "These are good examples to use, good intuition. This class is great.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A friend of mine, Yann LeCun...\" lol\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification\n",
    "More than one category that we are trying to guess. For example: handwritten digits or recognizing different cars, trucks, or pedestrians.\n",
    "\n",
    "One output unit for every category -> output should be a vector where (hopefully) only one element is 1, the rest are all 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "One training exmaple is (x^i, y^i) where x^i is an image (in this case), and y is one of the output vectors.\n",
    "\n",

    "4/5 (80%)\n",
